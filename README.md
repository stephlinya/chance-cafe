#Chance Cafe

##what
A responsive website that features a cat cafe concept. I used this to practice my HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and design skills.

##future things
Currently, the dynamic card catalog on the cats page only works on my local environment. I'd also like to refactor the code so my website loads much faster.
